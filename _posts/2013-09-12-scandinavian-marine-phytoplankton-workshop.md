A Scandinavian Marine Phytoplankton Workshop was arranged 26-28 August 2013. Participants from Sweden, Norway and Denmark discussed the biodiversity of marine phytoplankton, possibilities for joint monitoring and data sharing. Improving collaboration related to warnings about harmful algal blooms was another agenda item. The web site [www.nordicmicroalgae.org](http://nordicmicroalgae.org/) is used by the participants who also contribute to the content. Sessions on the taxonomy of marine microalgae was also part of the workshop. The group SCAMPY was established. SCAMPY is an acronym for SCAndinavian Marine PhYtoplankton Group. A second workshop is planned to be arranged in Norway in 2014. The workshop was co-sponsored by Swedish Lifewatch and the EU Interreg project Hav möter land. It was arranged at the Sven Lovén Centre for Marine Sciences, Kristineberg, Fiskebäckskil, Sweden.
