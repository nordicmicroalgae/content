Plankton Toolbox has been updated. Changes include:

* The Plankton counter module has been modified after user feedback.
* A function to make a backup of your data is included in the Plankton counter module.
* A minimalistic example data set is included.
* Plankton groups have been changed to include only four main groups. The user can modify this.
* Taxon lists and the list of trophic types have been updated.
* A list of HAB-species based on the [IOC-UNESCO Taxonomic Reference List of Harmful Micro Algae](http://www.marinespecies.org/hab/) is included
* Mac users no longer need to use special software when unpacking Plankton Toolbox after download.

Go to [http://nordicmicroalgae.org/tools](http://nordicmicroalgae.org/tools) to get the new version.

Seasons greetings from the Plankton Toolbox team.
