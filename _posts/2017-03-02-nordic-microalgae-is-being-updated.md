__Nordic Microalgae is being updated__

Nordic Microalgae will be updated shortly. Updates include moving to a new server and updating server software etc. During this time new images should not be uploaded. After the update users adding content will need to renew their passwords. When the update is complete this will be announced. The plan is that the updated version should be up and running before March 10th.
