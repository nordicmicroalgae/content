A beta version of the updated Nordic Microalgae website is now accessible! The final version is scheduled for release on April 11, 2024.

The update includes a new web-interface and a major update of the taxonomic backbone, now following current accepted names in World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), and supplementary facts has been updated to follow the most current information available. Taxonomic information is now managed by monitoring taxonomic revisions in WoRMS and AlgaeBase, thereby facilitating the maintenance of an up-to-date taxonomic backbone. Additionally, new features have been introduced, such as occurrence maps on taxon sheets, which are sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Maps API. 

Links are now provided for taxa present in WoRMS, Dyntaxa, AlgaeBase, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), IOC-UNESCO Taxonomic Reference List of Harmful Micro Algae (IOC HAB), The Norwegian Culture Collection of Algae (NORCCA), European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Protist Ribosomal Reference (PRÂ²) database, and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System database (ITIS).
