Plankton Toolbox is now accessible in version 1.4.2, designed for Windows and MacOS with Apple Silicon processors. This latest release incorporates bug fixes for an improved user experience. Notably, the NOMP 2024 biovolume list has been integrated, comprising data from the HELCOM-PEG 2024 biovolume list and additional taxa sourced from the Skagerrak and the North Sea. The list of potentially harmful taxa has been updated according to the [IOC-UNESCO Taxonomic Reference List of Harmful Micro Algae](http://www.marinespecies.org/hab/).

Support for Mac Intel processors was discontinued in version 1.4.2. However, version 1.4.1 remains available and now includes updated taxa lists.

To obtain this update, navigate to the [Tools/Plankton Toolbox](/plankton-toolbox/) menu for download the software. For a full changelog, please refer to Plankton Toolbox [GitHub page](https://github.com/planktontoolbox/plankton-toolbox).
