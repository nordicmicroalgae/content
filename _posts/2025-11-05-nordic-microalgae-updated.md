## Nordic Microalgae Update

Nordic Microalgae has been updated with a security patch and several new features designed to improve usability and data accessibility (both backend and frontend).

### What’s New

- **Improved search experience:**  
  The search bar is now more visible and automatically activated when you enter the site, making searches quicker and easier.

- **Child taxon media:**  
  Each taxon sheet now includes a section displaying images of their direct child taxa. The new section is located below the occurrence map.

- **Smarter occurrence maps:**  
  Occurrence maps on taxon sheets now include WoRMS synonyms. You can control the visible layers by selecting **“Show layer control”** below the map.

- **Updated external links:**  
  All previously broken external links have been reviewed and fixed.

- **New Tools page:**  
  A new [**SHARK4R**](/shark4r/) tool page has been added.
