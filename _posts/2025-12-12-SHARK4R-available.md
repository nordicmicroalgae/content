## SHARK4R available on CRAN

A new R package is now available on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). `SHARK4R` gives researchers and environmental analysts a tool to access, quality-check, and process marine environmental data directly in R, a popular programming language and statistical tool for data analysis and visualization.

One of the key applications of `SHARK4R` is its integration with Nordic Microalgae. All data on Nordic Microalgae is accessible via its API, which `SHARK4R` can connect to directly. This allows users to retrieve species information, images, and associated metadata for analysis and visualization in R.

In addition to data retrieval, `SHARK4R` provides automatic quality control for biological, physical, and chemical parameters when integrating data from various sources. 

`SHARK4R` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SHARK4R), and full documentation, including getting started guides and examples using Nordic Microalgae, can be found on [GitHub](https://sharksmhi.github.io/SHARK4R/).
