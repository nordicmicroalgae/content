Nordic Microalgae has been updated with new features to help you find and use our image collections more easily.

### What's New

- **Image Labeling Guide:**  
  A new [**Image Labeling Guide**](/image-labeling/) provides reference images and identification guidelines for standardized taxonomic classification from automated imaging instruments.

- **Organized image collections:**  
  Images are now better organized on taxon pages, with citizen science and automated contributions imaging clearly separated from expert-verified images for easier navigation.

- **Updated homepage statistics:**  
  The homepage now displays separate counts for Expert Images, Image Labeling, and Citizen Science images, giving you a clearer overview of our diverse image collections.
