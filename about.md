Nordic microalgae aim to provide high quality images, illustrations and information (e.g. occurrences, trophic role, size, morphology and harmfulness) of aquatic microalgae and related organisms in the Nordic region. The organisms included are Phytoplankton, microzooplankton (i.e. cyanobacteria, unicellular eukaryotic algae and heterotrophic protists), benthic microalgae and benthic microheterotrophs. All images on the website are provided by microalgae experts.

Nordic microalgae also provide a species checklist for Nordic waters. The taxonomic information (including the higher taxonomy and synonyms) of Nordic Microalge is based on the current accepted name in World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). Supplementary information, including geometric shapes, is sourced from the Nordic Marine Phytoplankton Group (NOMP) biovolume list. Taxa occurences are collected from the GBIF Maps API. Links are provided for taxa present on AlgaeBase, Dyntaxa, GBIF, ENA, NCBI, ITIS, IOC HAB, and NORCCA: The Norwegian Culture Collection of Algae (only strains originating from Northern Europe).

The Swedish Research Council have provided long-term funding of Nordic Microalgae since 2010 through Swedish Lifewatch (2010-2020) and Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (2021-Present).

The Nordic microalgae history started in 1996 when Mats Kuylenstierna and Bengt Karlson lanched the first webside with a checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat. The inter-regional EU project Forum Skagerrak II provided initial funding for transferring the checklist to a website. 
In 2011 the first version of Nordic microalgae was released based on the Skagerrak-Kattegat checklist combined with a number of other specieslists, read more under[Checklists and biovolumes](/nordicmicroalgae.org/checklists-and-biovolumes/).

In 2024 the taxonomic backbone of Nordic Microalgae was updated and the website was moved to a new platform.
