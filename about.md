Nordic microalgae aim to provide high quality images, illustrations and information (e.g. occurrences, trophic role, size, morphology and harmfulness) of aquatic microalgae and related organisms in the Nordic region. The organisms included are Phytoplankton, microzooplankton (i.e. cyanobacteria, unicellular eukaryotic algae and heterotrophic protists), benthic microalgae and benthic microheterotrophs. All images on the website are provided by microalgae experts.

Nordic microalgae also provide a [species checklist](/checklist/) for Nordic waters. The taxonomic information (including the higher taxonomy and synonyms) of Nordic Microalge is based on the current accepted name in World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). Supplementary information, including geometric shapes, is sourced from the Nordic Marine Phytoplankton Group (NOMP) biovolume list which includes information from the HELCOM EG Phyto Biovolume list. Links are provided for taxa present in WoRMS, Dyntaxa, AlgaeBase, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), IOC-UNESCO Taxonomic Reference List of Harmful Micro Algae (IOC HAB), The Norwegian Culture Collection of Algae (NORCCA, only strains originating from Northern Europe), European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Protist Ribosomal Reference (PR2), and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System database (ITIS).

The Swedish Research Council have provided long-term funding of Nordic Microalgae since 2010 through Swedish Lifewatch (2010-2020) and Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (2021-Present).

A new version of Nordic microalgae was released in 2024, including an updated taxonomic backbone, a new platform and new functionality. Taxonomic information is now managed by monitoring taxonomic revisions in WoRMS and AlgaeBase, thereby facilitating the maintenance of an up-to-date taxonomic backbone. Additionally, new features have been introduced, such as occurrence maps on taxon sheets, which are sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Maps API.

The Nordic Microalgae history started in 1996 when Mats Kuylenstierna and Bengt Karlson at the University of Gothenburg launched the web site [Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat](https://www.smhi.se/oceanografi/oce_info_data/plankton_checklist/ssshome.htm) (__Fig. 1__). The inter-regional EU project Forum Skagerrak II provided initial funding for transferring the checklist to a new website. Long term funding provided by the Swedish Research Council through Swedish Lifewatch resulted in a first release of the Nordic Microalgae web site in 2011 (__Fig. 2__).

In 2011 the first version of Nordic microalgae was released (__Fig 2__) based on the Skagerrak-Kattegat checklist combined with a number of other species lists, read more under [Nordic Microalgae checklist](/checklist/).
