## Main objectives

1. To provide information on the biodiversity of aquatic microalgae and related organisms in the Nordic area.
2. To provide up to date species lists of microalgae and related organisms in the Nordic area. The plan is to publish them once and then provide yearly updates. The species lists may be usable as reference lists. The organisms are:
    * Phytoplankton and and microzooplankton (i.e. cyanobacteria, unicellular eukaryotic algae and heterotrophic protists).
    * Benthic microalgae and benthic microheterotrophs.
3. To provide information about the systematic position of the organisms.
    * The systematics of organisms is bound to change as knowledge increases. Nordic Microalgae should reflect the latest widely accepted version.
    * Nordic Microalgae cooperates with [AlgaeBase](http://www.algaebase.org/), [the IOC-HAB programme](http://hab.ioc-unesco.org/), [World Register of Marine Species](http://www.marinespecies.org/) and the [Swedish Species Information Centre](https://www.artdatabanken.se/en/).
4. To provide high quality images, illustrations and videos of the organisms.
    * The content is provided by microalgae experts in the area.
5. To provide information relevant for environmental monitoring, e.g.
    * Main habitat of organisms
    * Trophic role of organisms
    * Morphology
    * Biovolume information for biomass calculations
    * Geographical distribution
    * Harmfulness
    * Size
    * etc.
  
## History

In 2024 the Nordic Microalgae website was moved to a new platform, also the taxonomic backbone was updated. Nordic Microalgae was first released in 2011. It was based on the website [Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat (including heterotrophic protists)](http://www.smhi.se/oceanografi/oce_info_data/plankton_checklist/ssshome.htm) launched in 1996 by Bengt Karlson and Mats Kuylenstierna at GÃ¶teborg University, Sweden. In 2007 the inter-regional EU project Forum Skagerrak II provided initial funding for transferring the Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat to modern website technology. Since 2010 the Swedish Research Council has provided long-term funding of Nordic Microalgae through Swedish Lifewatch (2010-2020) and Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (2021-Present).

The [Nordic Microalgae check list](http://nordicmicroalgae.org/checklists) compiled in 2011 was based on the Skagerrak-Kattegat checklist, a list of marine phytoplankton monitored in Sweden provided by SMHI, the list of taxa in the HELCOM Phytoplankton Expert Group list of taxa and biovolumes, a list of Swedish freshwater phytoplankton from the Swedish Freshwater monitoring database at SLU in Uppsala, a list of Swedish freshwater benthic diatoms provided by Maria Kahlert (SLU Uppsala), a list of marine phytoplankton from the Danish database STOCK, a list of marine phytoplankton from Norway provided by Wenche Eikrem and Bente Edvardsen (University of Oslo), a list of freshwater phytoplankton from Norway provided by Birger Skjelbred (NIVA) from the REBECCA database and a list of taxa from the Finnish Phytoplankton Society, provided by Kristiina Vuorio (SYKE). The 2011 list has been amended and names of taxa have been updated to reflect the current information in the [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/) and [AlgaeBase](https://www.algaebase.org/).
