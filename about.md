## About

Nordic microalgae aim to provide high quality images, illustrations and information (e.g. habitat, trophic role, size, morphology and harmfulness) of aquatic microalgae and related organisms. The organisms included are Phytoplankton, microzooplankton (i.e. cyanobacteria, unicellular eukaryotic algae and heterotrophic protists), benthic microalgae and benthic microheterotrophs. 

The images on the website are provided by microalgae experts.

Nordic microalgae also provide a species checklist for Nordic waters. The taxonomic information (including the higher taxonomy and synonyms) of Nordic Microalge is based on the current accepted name in World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). Supplementary information, including geometric shapes, is sourced from the NOMP biovolume file. Links are also provided for taxa present on AlgaeBase, Dyntaxa and NORCCA: The Norwegian Culture Collection of Algae.

The first version of Nordic Microalgae was released in 2011 and was based on the website [Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat (including heterotrophic protists)](http://www.smhi.se/oceanografi/oce_info_data/plankton_checklist/ssshome.htm) launched in 1996 by Bengt Karlson and Mats Kuylenstierna at Göteborg University. In 2007 the inter-regional EU project Forum Skagerrak II provided initial funding for transferring the checklist to a website. Since 2010 the Swedish Research Council has provided long-term funding of Nordic Microalgae through Swedish Lifewatch (2010-2020) and Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (2021-Present).

In 2024 the taxonomic backbone of Nordic Microalgae was updated and the website was moved to a new platform.
