## About

Nordic Microalgae is built upon the concept of taxon sheets. The most interesting sheets are at the species level where you will find illustrations and other information about a species. To reach species sheets you can use the TAXON TREE , QUICK VIEW or click om more about in the GALLERIES. Filters can be used to restrict what you see. If you know the name or part of the name of an organism the search function may be useful. Please get in touch with us if you have problems or suggestions for new functionality.

The aim with Nordic microalgae is to provide high quality images, illustrations and information (e.g. habitat, trophic role, size, morphology and harmfulness) of aquatic microalgae and related organisms. The organisms included are Phytoplankton, microzooplankton (i.e. cyanobacteria, unicellular eukaryotic algae and heterotrophic protists), benthic microalgae and benthic microheterotrophs. 

The images on the website are provided by microalgae experts.

The aim is also to provide an up-to-date species-list for the Nordic area. The taxonomic information (including the higher taxonomy and synonyms) of Nordic Microalge is based on the current accepted name in World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). Supplementary information, including geometric shapes, is sourced from the NOMP biovolume file. Links are also provided for taxa present on AlgaeBase, Dyntaxa and NORCCA: The Norwegian Culture Collection of Algae.

In 2024 the Nordic Microalgae website was moved to a new platform and the taxonomic backbone was updated. The first version of Nordic Microalgae was released in 2011. It was based on the website [Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat (including heterotrophic protists)](http://www.smhi.se/oceanografi/oce_info_data/plankton_checklist/ssshome.htm) launched in 1996 by Bengt Karlson and Mats Kuylenstierna at Göteborg University, Sweden. In 2007 the inter-regional EU project Forum Skagerrak II provided initial funding for transferring the Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat to modern website technology. Since 2010 the Swedish Research Council has provided long-term funding of Nordic Microalgae through Swedish Lifewatch (2010-2020) and Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (2021-Present).
