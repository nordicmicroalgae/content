## HELCOM EG PHYTO Biovolume list

The latest update of the HELCOM EG PHYTO (previously PEG) list of biovolumes of phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea and the Kattegat-Skagerrak is available at ICES as a [zip-file](http://ices.dk/data/Documents/ENV/PEG_BVOL.zip).

## NOMP Biovolume list

The Nordic Marine Phytoplankton Group (NOMP) biovolume list comprise of data from the HELCOM EG PHYTO biovolume list and data from additional taxa sourced from the Skagerrak and the North Sea, provided by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute and the Norwegian Institute for Water Research. The list is updated once per year, normally after the [annual NOMP workshop](nordicmicroalgae.org/nomp/), and can be accessed below.
