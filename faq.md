#### I want to use one or several images from Nordic Microalgae in  a publication. Can you give me permission to use them?

You need to get in touch directly with the copyright holders of the images you want to use. The name of the copyright holder is shown when you click on the text _Additional image information_ close to the image.

#### I cannot find a species I expect to find.

Try a synonym in the search field. If you still do not find the species it could probably be added to the species list. Contact Nordic Microalgae at [nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se](mailto:nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se) and provide a link to the taxon in WoRMS and/or AlgaeBase.

#### How do I create a new gallery?

All registrered contributors can create new galleries when submitting or editing your image information, please follow the step-by-step contributor guide that can be found under [How to contribute](/how-to-contribute/). If you would like a text associated to your gallery, please e-mail [nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se](mailto:nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se).
