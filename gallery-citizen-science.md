title: Citizen science

This gallery is aimed for images from citizen science. This means that although the images may be of high quality, the identification of organisms is not made by trained experts. Thus there may be uncertainty of the identity of organims. The images can be aquired using standard microscopes or other devices. One example is the low cost, partly 3D-printed, OpenFlexure microscope https://openflexure.org. Another example of a citizen science initiative is the PlanktoScope https://www.planktoscope.org.
