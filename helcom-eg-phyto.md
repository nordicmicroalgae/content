## HELCOM EG Phyto (previously HELCOM PEG)

Established in 1991, [HELCOM EG Phyto](https://helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/peg/) was formed with the primary objective of standardizing the methodologies for collecting, counting, and identifying phytoplankton species in the Baltic Sea. Given the critical significance of precise biomass estimation in phytoplankton monitoring, EG Phyto has dedicated substantial efforts to standardizing size-classes and biovolumes of phytoplankton species prevalent in the Baltic Sea region. Utilizing a standardized species list with predefined size-classes and biovolumes stands as a pivotal measure aimed at enhancing the accuracy of phytoplankton counting methods and facilitating the comparability of outcomes.
