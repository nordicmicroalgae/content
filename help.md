## Frequently asked questions, FAQ

* Question: I want to use one or several images from Nordic Microalgae in  a publication. Can you give me permission to use them?

Answer: Thank you for your request. You need to get in touch directly with the copyright holders of the images you want to use. The name of the copyright holder is shown when you click on the text __Additional information__ close to the image.

* Question: I cannot find a species I expect to find.

Answer: Try a synonym in the search field. If you still do not find the species it should probably be added to the species list. Contact Nordic Microalgae at [nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se](mailto:nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se) or a member of your national microalgae committee. (At present Finland, Norway and Sweden).
