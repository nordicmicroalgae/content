In 1996 the web site [Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat (including heterotrophic protists)](http://www.smhi.se/oceanografi/oce_info_data/plankton_checklist/ssshome.htm) was launched by Bengt Karlson and Mats Kuylenstierna at GÃ¶teborg University, Sweden.  Most of the image content was produced using analogue video technique and the web pages were to a large extent produced using manual html-coding. Since then digital photography and digital video have become ubiquitous and technological advances in information technology can be used to share and disseminate information about marine organisms more efficiently. In 2007 the inter-regional EU project Forum Skagerrak II provided initial funding for transferring the Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat to modern web site technology. This site was never published officially due to lack of long term funding. The name was B-NEAT (Baltic and North East Atlantic Taxa).
