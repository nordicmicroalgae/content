In 2024 the Nordic Microalgae web site was moved to a new platform, also the taxonomic backbone was updated. Nordic Microalgae was first released in 2011. It was based on the web site [Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat (including heterotrophic protists)](http://www.smhi.se/oceanografi/oce_info_data/plankton_checklist/ssshome.htm) launched in 1996 by Bengt Karlson and Mats Kuylenstierna at GÃ¶teborg University, Sweden. In 2007 the inter-regional EU project Forum Skagerrak II provided initial funding for transferring the Checklist of phytoplankton in the Skagerrak-Kattegat to modern web site technology. Since 2010 the Swedish Research Council  has provided long-term funding of Nordic Microalgae through Swedish Lifewatch (2010-2020) and Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (2021-Present).

The [Nordic Microalgae check list](http://nordicmicroalgae.org/checklists) compiled in 2011 was based on the Skagerrak-Kattegat checklist, a list of marine phytoplankton monitored in Sweden provided by SMHI,  the list of taxa in the HELCOM Phytoplankton Expert Group list of taxa and biovolumes, a list of Swedish freshwater phytoplankton from the Swedish Freshwater monitoring database at SLU in Uppsala, a list of Swedish freshwater benthic diatoms provided by Maria Kahlert (SLU Uppsala), a list of marine phytoplankton from the Danish database STOCK, a list of marine phytoplankton from Norway provided by Wenche Eikrem and Bente Edvardsen (University of Oslo), a list of freshwater phytoplankton from Norway provided by Birger Skjelbred (NIVA) and a list of taxa from the Finnish Phytoplankton Society. The 2011 list has been amended and names of taxa have been updated to reflect the current information in the [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/) and [AlgaeBase](https://www.algaebase.org/).
