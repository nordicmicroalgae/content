Nordic Microalgae caters for scientists and persons involved in environmental monitoring of aquatic microalgae and related organisms in the Nordic area. This includes the Baltic Sea, the North East Atlantic and lakes, rivers and streams in the area. The website is maintained by active biologists in the area. Experts on the different groups of organisms maintain the species lists and the other information on taxon sheets. Anyone with illustrative images, videos and other material is welcome to contribute. Since Nordic Microalgae is user driven your contribution is very important. There are four types of users/contributors to Nordic Microalgae

1. Anyone using the internet can browse the website and download species lists and images (with copyright restrictions)
2. Contributors of images can upload images, add texts about the images and edit and delete his or her own material – a username and password is needed
3. A smaller group of experts can in addition edit information about species
4. Nordic Microalgae administrators can edit everything and also add and delete species names

## How to get a user identity and a password

Please register as a contributor by sending an e-mail to [nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se](mailto:nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se). You will receive a temporary password, and will be asked to log in and change your password and enter your contact information.

When you register you agree that your name is shown on [www.nordicmicroalgae.org](http://nordicmicroalgae.org) and that information about you is stored in the contributor database. Your e-mail address will not be shown to the public. It is your responsibility to make sure that you have the right to upload images to Nordic Microalgae. The creator (photographer or artist) keeps the copyright to the image. Please select one of the four options below when you upload images. Option number 2 is recommended in general.

## About contribution of images

Please contribute images for any organism in Nordic Microalgae. There is no restriction of the number of images per taxon but more than ten is seldom useful. Most important are images of organisms that are not yet well illustrated. Before you consider contribution make sure that you understand the implications for copyright holders by reading the [Terms of use](/terms-of-use). All types of high-quality images are requested, e.g.

* Images of the whole organism
* Images showing details important for identification
* Images showing interesting behaviour
* Images of live organisms as well as organisms preserved with different preservatives (Lugol’s, formalin, glutardialdehyde etc.)
* Images obtained using different techniques for contrast enhancement, e.g. phase contrast, interference contrast and standard light microscopy
* Images of organisms observed in the fluorescence microscope
* Images showing natural fluorescence and/or fluorescence from different stains such as DAPI, Calcofluor etc.
* Images of organisms observed in the electron microscope

It is also useful showing an organism at different focus levels. Taking several photographs at different z-level (focus) and stitching them together in the computer is one way to achieve a useful film. Please use arrows and other markers where appropriate. Scale bars are very useful in images.

## Change history

Please note that all changes in Nordic Microalgae, e.g. the addition of images and changes in texts on taxon sheets are recorded. The latest added images show up on the start page.
