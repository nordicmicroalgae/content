## About the Imaging FlowCytobot

The Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) is an automated microscope integrated into a flow cytometer that generates plankton images. The IFCB can be operated in situ or in air pumping water to the instrument. Water samples are collected automatically about every 20 minutes. The plankton in the sample passes trough a flow chamber and are imaged by a camera triggered by fluorescence or scattering of the plankton organism. Thousands of images are collected for each sample. To identify the plankton in the images machine learning methods are used. Phytoplankton identifications specialists annotate images to create training sets. Nordic Microalgae provides links to annotated images (see below).

## Annotated images from the IFCB
Here, we offer links to published datasets obtained through the Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) in Northern Europe. Sets of manually annotated images are available for training your image classifier. If you have a published dataset that you would like to include in this list, please contact us via email at nordicmicroalgae@smhi.se.
