## SHARK4R

SHARK4R is an R package that provides a client application for integration with multiple marine and taxonomic data services. It is designed to access and process data from a range of sources, making it a powerful tool for marine researchers and data managers.

With SHARK4R, you can easily query and work with microalgal data from:  

- [Nordic Microalgae](https://nordicmicroalgae.org/)
- [SHARK](https://shark.smhi.se/)
- [AlgaeBase](https://www.algaebase.org/)
- [World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)](https://www.marinespecies.org/)
- [Dyntaxa](https://artfakta.se/)
- [IOC-UNESCO Taxonomic Reference List of Harmful Micro Algae](https://www.marinespecies.org/hab/)
- [IOC-UNESCO Toxins database](https://toxins.hais.ioc-unesco.org/)
  
Learn more and get started here: [SHARK4R GitHub Pages](https://sharksmhi.github.io/SHARK4R/). 

SHARK4R is used to prepare and process the taxonomic backbone of Nordic Microalgae in our [data pipeline](https://github.com/nordicmicroalgae/pipeline).
